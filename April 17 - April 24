Hey Marc, 

Highlights for me this week 
- Liberty under attack partnership
- Convo with the guy from PPQ.AI
- Kagi search, checkout the AMA and the search engine, the thing is pretty slick.
- Nos.Social + Highlighter + Cypherspace + Mash + Stacker News + Fountain + Sats4AI + Geyser is a deadly combination 
- Didnt know if you wanted the Saylor Odell controversy in there, apparantly Cathy Woods was about to donate a portion of the etf profits to opensats but Michael Saylor told her "If you do that I'll destroy you"....
