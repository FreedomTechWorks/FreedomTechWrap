Ideas 
- TheBitcoinBugle just dropped a podcast, they also have a geyser campagin which has raised almost 100k sats. Setting up a Geyser account and having a section in the script shouting out geyser and geyser projects might be cool. 
- Marketing (I'll look into boosting/clipping/Crossposting episodes to nostr from sn)
- SN Ideas 
 - AMA (I'm Marks from the Freedom Tech Wrap Podcast Ask me anything) 
 - Freedom Tech Wrap Territory (discuss freedom tech and upload applicable updates/releases for sats.)
