### Articles 
- The INFOSEC BASICS: HOW TO KEEP YOUR BITCOIN SEED PHRASE SECURE [Bitcoin Magazine](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/the-infosec-basics-how-to-keep-your-bitcoin-seed-phrase-secure) 
 - Never share your seed phrase with anyone: Your seed phrase grants full control over your Bitcoin wallet, so never give it to others under any circumstance.
 - Avoid digital storage methods: Computers and online platforms are vulnerable to hacking and malware attacks, which could expose your seed phrase. Use physical, non-digital means to store your seed phrase.
 - Choose durable materials for storing your seed phrase: Opt for metal tiles or plates instead of paper, as these materials provide better protection against damage and degradation over time.
 - Store your seed phrase in a secure location: Keep your seed phrase in a locked safe or a securely hidden area away from unauthorized access. Consider splitting your backup using trusted protocols like Seed XOR or Shamir's Secret Sharing for added security.
 - Regularly check on your seed phrase backup: Ensure that your seed phrase remains safely stored and undisturbed by periodically checking its condition and location.
- Judge Imposes Worldwide Asset Freeze on Fake Satoshi Craig Wright [Bitcoin Magazine](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/judge-imposes-worldwide-asset-freeze-on-fake-satoshi-craig-wright)
 - A UK judge imposed a worldwide asset freeze on Craig Wright, the man who falsely claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin.

 - Wright must now reveal all assets above $30,000 and cannot reduce his total assets below $7.6 million. This action aims to ensure funds are available to pay COPA's expected costs.
