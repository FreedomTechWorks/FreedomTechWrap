### Articles 
- DOGMA KILLS BRAIN CELLS by Shinobi [Bitcoin Magazine](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/dogma-kills-brain-cells)
 - The article asserts - 
 - Dogmatic beliefs are necessary foundations for communities and cultures, but they often lead to stagnation and dissent.
 - As dogma fractures, it tends to reinforce the existing dogma within those who remain while creating multiple conflicting ideologies alongside it.
 - The Protestant Reformation led to a proliferation of various conflicting ideologies rather than destroying the Catholic Church.
 - Dissent breeds further dissent, leading to the formation of numerous conflicting dogmas instead of a single dominant one.
 - New dogmas tend to define themselves primarily by their opposition to existing ones, which makes them vulnerable to losing their identity if the opposing dogma is defeated.
 - For a movement or culture to create a lasting impact, it must have a solid foundation of identity that can exist independently of opposition.
