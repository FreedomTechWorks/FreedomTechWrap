- Argentina Creates Mandatory Registry for Bitcoin Service Providers Operating in the Country [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/03/31/argentina-unveiled-mandatory-registry-for-bitcoin-and-crypto-platforms/?sh=68f817cf59fe)
 -Anarcho-capitalist and libertarian leader Javier Milei took power in Argentina in December 2023, leading to expectations of increased Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrency adoption.
However, in late March, the Comisi√≥n Nacional de Valores (CNV) in Argentina announced a new mandatory Registry of Virtual Asset Service Providers for those operating with crypto assets in the country.
Companies and individuals involved in activities like buying, selling, sending, receiving, lending, or trading cryptos must complete the registration, affecting both local and foreign providers.
Critics argue that the new requirement does not align with Milei's pro-Bitcoin stance and could benefit only state bureaucrats and compliance industries.

### Articles 
- Decentralization and localized manufacturing: Bitcoin, AI and 3D printing [Bitcoin Magazine](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/decentralization-and-localized-manufacturing-bitcoin-ai-and-3d-printing) by Emile Phaneuf
 - Decentralization and localized manufacturing have been key drivers of disruption throughout history, including advances in agriculture, knightly technology, gunpowder, and the printing press.
 - Bitcoin serves as an alternative to traditional monetary systems controlled by nation states, but faces challenges due to its reliance on hardware produced by a limited number of manufacturers.
 - Artificial Intelligence also poses risks to decentralization, as governments may seek to regulate or control technologies that favor individuals over the state.
 - Localized manufacturing through 3D printers and "maker" tools offers a promising pathway toward greater decentralization, though it may face opposition from governments seeking to maintain control over these technologies.
