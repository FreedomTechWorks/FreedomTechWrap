### Article 
- Decentralization and localized manufacturing: Bitcoin, AI and 3D printing [Bitcoin Magazine](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/decentralization-and-localized-manufacturing-bitcoin-ai-and-3d-printing) by Emile Phaneuf
 - Decentralization and localized manufacturing have been key drivers of disruption throughout history, including advances in agriculture, knightly technology, gunpowder, and the printing press.
 - Bitcoin serves as an alternative to traditional monetary systems controlled by nation states, but faces challenges due to its reliance on hardware produced by a limited number of manufacturers.
 - Artificial Intelligence also poses risks to decentralization, as governments may seek to regulate or control technologies that favor individuals over the state.
 - Localized manufacturing through 3D printers and "maker" tools offers a promising pathway toward greater decentralization, though it may face opposition from governments seeking to maintain control over these technologies.
